# AIm - AI Manager for DeFi Agents

![AIm Logo](client/public/logo.png)

## Project Overview

AIm is an AI manager that automatically creates and manages DeFi agents, optimizing their interaction with decentralized finance. As part of the development, a smart contract was deployed on the Sonic Blaze testnet, and the Zerepy framework was configured and launched.

Zerepy is deployed as a server, and we use its endpoints to access the server, which allows connecting various plugins and executing any tasks in the blockchain network.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Creation of DeFi Agents
- AIm allows users to quickly deploy custom AI agents for various DeFi scenarios (liquidity, lending, arbitrage, hedging)
- Use of Zerepy API for flexible configuration of agent parameters and their interaction with markets

### 2. Cross-Chain Interactivity with deBridge
- deBridge connection allows AI agents to interact with assets and data across multiple blockchains
- Flexibility in choosing the best DeFi products through cross-chain transactions
- Automation of bridges for transferring liquidity between different ecosystems

### 3. Self-learning AI through Allora
- AIm uses Allora Network for adaptive machine learning
- AI agents analyze data, make predictions, and adjust strategies in real-time
- Advanced protection mechanisms against market manipulations and bots

### 4. Integration with Sonic Blaze
- All AI agents operate through a smart contract in the Sonic Blaze testnet, ensuring security and transparency
- Use of Sonic's built-in functions for transaction automation and asset control

### 5. Autonomous Optimization of DeFi Operations
- AI agents independently analyze markets, make decisions, and execute strategies
- Minimization of manual management: the system suggests strategies based on market data

## Technical Capabilities

### 1. Smart Contract in Sonic Blaze
- Ensures security and transparency of all operations
- Used for automatic execution of AI agent strategies

### 2. Zerepy Framework
- Launched as a server, provides interaction with the blockchain
- Supports plugins that extend the functionality of DeFi agents
- Flexibility in configuring and launching new tasks via API

### 3. Integration with deBridge
- AI agents can interact with assets on different blockchains
- Support for automated bridges for moving liquidity

### 4. Using Allora for Self-learning AI
- AI agents adapt to changing market conditions
- Strategy optimization based on machine learning

## Zerepy Plugins and Their Functionality

Zerepy supports a system of modular plugins, allowing AI agents to be adapted for various tasks:

### ðŸ”¹ Liquidity Manager

- Automatic transfer of funds to increase yield
- Integration with deBridge for cross-chain operations

### ðŸ”¹ Risk Analyzer
- Analysis of DeFi strategy risks
- Assessment of asset volatility and APY changes
- Calculation of credit risk when using lending platforms
- Monitoring of smart contract security parameters

### ðŸ”¹ Yield Optimizer
- Automatic yield optimization
- Connection to the pool with maximum APR
- Implementation of complex reinvestment strategies
- Use of AI models based on Allora for dynamic adaptation

### ðŸ”¹ Transaction Bundler
- Grouping and optimization of transactions
- Reduction of gas costs by combining operations
- Intelligent transaction routing

### ðŸ”¹ On-Chain Data Aggregator
- Collection and processing of data
- Collection of data on prices, liquidity, and user activity
- Analysis of market trends for decision-making by AI agents
- Support for API integrations with external data sources

## Why AIm Uses Allora and deBridge

- âœ… Allora makes AI agents self-learning, increasing their accuracy and efficiency
- âœ… deBridge opens up the possibility of working with liquidity on multiple blockchains without manual intervention
- âœ… The combination of Allora + deBridge + Zerepy forms an autonomous ecosystem of DeFi agents
- This gives AIm a unique advantage in the market of automated DeFi solutions

## Current Project Status

- âœ… Smart contract deployed in the Sonic Blaze testnet
- âœ… Zerepy framework configured and launched as a server
- âœ… Zerepy endpoints integrated for flexible configuration of DeFi agents
- âœ… deBridge and Allora connected
